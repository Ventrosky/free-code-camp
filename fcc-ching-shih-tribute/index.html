		<p><strong>Madame Ching</strong> or <strong>Ching Shih</strong> (1775–1844), also known as <strong>Cheng I Sao</strong> ("wife of Cheng I"), was a pirate in middle Qing China, who terrorized the China Sea in the early 19th century. She commanded over 300 junks (traditional Chinese sailing ships) manned by 20,000 to 40,000 pirates men, women, and even children. She entered into conflict with the major nations, such as the British Empire, the Portuguese Empire, and the Qing dynasty. She was one of the few pirate captains to retire from piracy and is considered to be the most successful pirate in history.</p>
		<h4>The code of conduct:<small><a href="#section1">[1]</a></small></h4>
		<ol>
			<li>If you disobey an order, you get your head chopped off and body thrown in the ocean.</li>
			<li>If you steal anything from the common plunder before it has been divvied up, you get your head chopped off and body thrown in the ocean.</li>
			<li>If you rape anyone without permission from the leader of your squadron, you get your head chopped off and your body thrown in the ocean.</li>
			<li>If you have consensual sex with anyone while on duty, you get your head chopped off and your body thrown in the ocean and the woman involved would get something heavy strapped to her and also tossed in the ocean.</li>
			<li>If you loot a town or ship of anything at all or otherwise harass them when they have paid tribute, you get your head chopped off and your body thrown into the ocean.</li>
			<li>If you take shore-leave without permission, you get your head chopped off and body thrown into the ocean.</li>
			<li>If you try to leave the organization, you get your ears chopped off.</li>
			<li>Captured ugly women were to be set free unharmed. Captured pretty women could be divvied up or purchased by members of the Red Flag Fleet. However, if a pirate was awarded or purchased a pretty woman, he was then considered married to her and was expected to treat her accordingly. If he didn’t, he gets his head cut off and body thrown in the ocean.</li>
